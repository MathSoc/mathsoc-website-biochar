The MathSoc Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the legal, financial, and human resource concerns of the organization as well as long-term planning (Bylaw 6.1). This includes advocacy, overseeing long-term projects with the faculty, as well as appointing and evaluating executives each term.

## How am I represented on the Board?

MathSoc Board is composed of up to 16 voting members: the 6 executives, plus up to 6 At-Large Directors, 2 Council Representatives, and 2 Community Representatives (Bylaw 6.2). Each Director usually serves for one year, and at the General Meeting each term, any MathSoc member can nominate themselves to become an At-Large Director for the following term.
