# Volunteer with MathSoc!😊

Volunteering with MathSoc is a great way to meet other people in your faculty. While some positions are time sensitive we welcome applications at anytime. If you have questions about a role we recommend sending the corresponding VP or club an email. If a position that you are interested in is not currently open and you wish to receive a notification when it opens please email the VPC at vpc@mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca about what positions you are interested in and ensure to check this page regularly. We look forward to meeting you!
