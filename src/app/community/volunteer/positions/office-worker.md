Office Workers work in the MathSoc Office (MC 3038) to help students sign-out rental items, sell novelties and supplies, and aid students looking for help within the office. Office shifts are flexible and are low in required time commitment, and are supervised by an office manager. You are free to work on personal tasks when there is no one looking for assistance, and will get access to our stash of office worker snacks. We ask for a minimum time commitment of 2 hours a week. Please note this is an **in-person position**.
