# Lockers

If a student is on a study term and has paid their MathSoc fee, they are eligible to book a locker for the period of the term. **No perishable foods are allowed to be stored to avoid attracting pests**.

MathSoc offers lockers on a term-by-term basis, first-come-first-serve. For Spring 2025, locker sign outs will be available starting **May 12th for math students** who have paid their MathSoc fee, and **June 1st for non-math students** who have paid their MathSoc fee.

**Locker signouts are open for all MathSoc fee-paying students via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYMoaEG_BSbaDS6wZmkHFm7t-IuXOVNtRluq1AFO9XIa6SZg/viewform?usp=dialog).**
